# teamspeak-bot

TeamSpeak 3 MusicBot. Works with clientQuery to follow commands given by chat.

NOTE: 'ts3Beta' is [pyts3](https://github.com/benediktschmitt/py-ts3), only modified by me in order to work with clientQuery.

## Getting Started

Before running this bot you will need to open 'bot.py' file and fill some variables.

    API_KEY     - API key from ClientQuery, you can find it on TeamSpeak Client (Tools>Options>Addons).
    YT_API_KEY  - API key for YouTube, this is used for youtube search request. You can generate a key at https://console.developers.google.com .
    CHANNEL     - channel you want the bot to connect to.

After this you may run the program (with TeamSpeak3 Client running).
In order to get detail on what the bot can do, just text him "help" in private chat.
